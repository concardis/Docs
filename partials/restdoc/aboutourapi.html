<h1>Introduction</h1><br>
We offer a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> based API, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">HTTP Basic Access Authorization</a> and JSON as payload format.
<h1>Phylosophy</h1>
The API is designed to be human readable and easy to implement therefore tried and tested standards were used in developing the API. Developers should be empowered to implement business requirements in a pragmatic manner, whereas the product owners (merchants for example) have the flexibility to design products according to their vision.
<h1>System URLs and Endpoints</h1>
There are two main system URLs which are of interest:
<ul>
 	<li>https://api.payengine.de/v1</li>
 	<li>https://apitest.payengine.de/v1</li>
</ul>
<strong>api</strong> is the Live system, which will be used for <strong>real</strong> payments, whereas <strong>apitest</strong> is used for development and testing purposes.
